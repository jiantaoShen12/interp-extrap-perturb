Description: 'Compositional Perturbation Autoencoder (CPA) models single-cell gene expression under perturbations and covariates
              by decomposing expression into additive latent embeddings: a basal state, perturbation effects, and covariate effects. 
              To ensure that the basal embedding is disentangled, CPA employs an adversarial training approach.
              Auxiliary classifiers (discriminators) are trained to predict perturbations and covariates from the basal embedding,
              discouraging the basal representation from encoding such information.
              To model dose-response effects, CPA uses neural networks to encode continuous covariates and perturbants (e.g., time or dose);
              whereas combinatorial perturbations are modeled as an additive composition of these embeddings in the latent space.'
