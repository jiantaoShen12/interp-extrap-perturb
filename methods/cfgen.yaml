Description: CFGen is a flow-based model for producing multi-modal scRNA-seq data.
  CFGen builds on cellFlow (Palma et al.) and explicitly models the discrete, over-dispersed nature
  of single-cell counts when generating synthetic data.
Inspired by:
- CellFlow
Method: CFGen
Model:
- Optimal Transport
- Multi-modal
- Conditional Flow Matching
