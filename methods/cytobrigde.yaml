Description: |
  CytoBridge approximates the Unbalanced Mean Field Schrödinger Bridge (UMFSB) to model unbalanced stochastic cell dynamics with cell-cell interactions from snapshot data. It uses neural networks and flow matching to infer transition velocity, growth/death rates, and interaction potentials. The framework offers a unified approach to model time-series transcriptomics, elucidating how intercellular communication influences cellular processes and behaviors.

Task:
  - Trace Cell Populations
