Description: |
  CytoBridge approximates the Unbalanced Mean Field Schrödinger Bridge (UMFSB) to model unbalanced stochastic cell dynamics with cell-cell interactions from snapshot data.It uses neural networks and flow mathcing to explicitly learn transition velocity, growth/death rates, log density, and interaction potentials directly from data. The framework offers a unified approach to generative modeling of time-series transcriptomics, elucidating how intercellular communication influences cellular processes and behaviors.
