Description: "Squidiff pairs a semantic encoder with a conditional Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model.
 To model perturbations, it learns a 'direction vector' by calculating the difference between
 control and perturbed states in the latent space. It then predicts responses in new cell types by
 applying this vector using latent arithmetic (addition) to the new cell's latent representation.
 Similarly, it generates transient states in continuous processes like differentiation by interpolating along start and end points.
 Finally, it integrates an adaptor to encode chemical structures, enabling predictions for completely unseen drugs."
