Description: 'scVI is a scalable deep generative model for single-cell transcriptomics that models gene expression
 counts using a zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) distribution to account for overdispersion and high dropout rates. 
 This generative process is conditioned on a low-dimensional latent vector capturing biological variation,
 a scaling factor for sequencing depth, and categorical batch annotations. 
 scVI served as the basis for the development of the scvi-tools ecosystem and numerous other modules for single-cell analysis.'
