Description: "AMICI uses multi-headed cross-attention to model how receiver cells
 integrate information from spatial neighbors by generating query embeddings
 from learned cell-type-specific parameters that represent receiver identity, while neighboring non-self cells
 gene expression profiles generate keys and values through neural network embeddings. 
 Attention scores are computed as distance-weighted softmax over query-key products, 
 where each head learns interaction length scales and sender phenotypes,
 with the model reconstructing masked receiver expression as a residual from cell-type mean
 using attention-weighted aggregations of neighbor values. Sparsity-inducing penalties on attention weights
 and value matrices ensure only biologically relevant non-self neighbors contribute."
