Description: Multi-Omics Factor Analysis v2 (MOFA+) builds builds upon Bayesian Group Factor Analysis,
             using a matrix factorization approach to infer a low-dimensional representation of typically
             multi-modal data in the form of latent factors that capture the primary sources of variation
             across different data types (e.g., RNA expression, DNA methylation) and sample groups. 
             MOFA+ is trained using GPU-accelerated stochastic variational inference which ensures 
             scalability. It also combines Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD) priors, 
             which disentangle variation shared across or unique to specific data modalities and sample groups,
             with sparsity-inducing spike-and-slab priors on both factors and weights.
