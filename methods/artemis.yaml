Description: "ARTEMIS combines variational autoencoder with an unbalanced Diffusion
  Schr\xF6dinger Bridge to reconstruct continuous trajectories from time-series
  data. The methods trains a VAE first, then jointly trains the VAE and uDSB by
  solving the forward-backward SDEs in the latent space using neural networks."
