Description: CellFlow (Klein et al.) learns a neural vector field parameterised as a neural ODE,
 which predicts single-cell expression profiles under a wide range of experimental conditions. 
 The model encodes perturbations (labels or embeddings), covariates (dosage, batch, time, etc.), and sample descriptors
 using specialised embeddings, aggregates these using permutation-invariant pooling (multi-head attention or deep sets),
 and uses the resulting joint embedding to condition the flow module. 
 Flow matching and optimal transport are used to align control and perturbed cells, 
 thereby modeling both cellular heterogeneity and perturbation-specific effects,
 and enabling accurate counterfactual predictions.
