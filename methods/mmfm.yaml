Description: MMFM (Multi-Marginal Flow Matching) builds on Flow Matching to model
  cell trajectories across time and conditions. MMFM generalises the Conditional Flow
  Matching framework to incorporate multiple time points using a spline-based conditional
  probability path. Moreover, it leverages ideas from classifier-free guidance to
  incorporate multiple conditions.
