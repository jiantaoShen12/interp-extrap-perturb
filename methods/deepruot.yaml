Description: |
  DeepRUOT learns Regularized Unbalanced Optimal Transport (RUOT) to reconstruct continuous unbalanced stochastic dynamics from sparse time-resolved snapshots. By introducing Fisher-regularization, the method simultaneously inferring transition velocity, growth/death rates and log density without any prior knowledge. The framework transforms time-series transcriptomics data into a virtual dynamical system to identify single-cell growth and transition patterns, eliminating false transitions, and constructing the Waddington developmental landscape. .
