Description: DeepRUOT solves an Regularized Unbalanced Optimal Transport (RUOT) problem to reconstruct stochastic dynamics from sparse time-resolved snapshots. By introducing Fisher-regularization, the method simultaneously infers the transition velocity, growth/death rates without any prior knowledge. The framework transforms time-series transcriptomics data into a virtual dynamical system to identify single-cell growth and transition patterns, eliminating false transitions, and constructing the Waddington developmental landscape.
