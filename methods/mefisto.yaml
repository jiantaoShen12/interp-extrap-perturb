Description: MEFISTO extends MOFA+ by incorporating continuous covariates, such as time or spatial coordinates. 
             While MOFA+ assumes that samples are independent and identically distributed,
             MEFISTO overcomes this limitation by combining the factor analysis framework with Gaussian Processes,
             which explicitly model the spatio-temporal relationships between samples (cells).
             MEFISTO can also align samples from different groups (e.g., individuals or species)
             that have misaligned temporal or spatial profiles.
